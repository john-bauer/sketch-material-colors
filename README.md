## Getting Started
1) Download the Sketch File
2) Copy its contents into your project, or use it as a global library.
3) Apply layer styles to your shape under `ðŸŽ¨ Fills/Material/...`

## How It Works
If you're familiar with layer styles in Sketch, this pattern should look familiar. Layer styles can be applied to any shape. Select a shape, then under the `appearance` section on the right-hand side, you can select which layer style to apply.
